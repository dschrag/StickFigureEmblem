Models
- Blender could be a great tool to use to make our models
- Blender has a feature that exports to Three.js so we dont' have to worry about that
- Blender is open source. 
- Somehow incorporate the Unit Class into the models
- Animate the following things 
	- Attacking (Needed)
	- Movement (Needed)
	- Victory (Optional)
	- Defeat (Optional ?)
- Add models to the board. 

Unit Class
- Need to find a way to do effectively move units across the board.
